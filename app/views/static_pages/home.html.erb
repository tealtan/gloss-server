<h1><em>Gloss is —</em></h1>

<p>…a highlighter for the Internet.</p>

<p>…a bookmarklet that highlights sentences for anything you read online. Click a sentence, and it gets saved to your account.</p>

<p>…a place for those sentences you want to keep. Return to see the things you’ve read, month by month.</p>
